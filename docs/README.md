Information of how to use `zod-extras` package.

## Preprocessors

The zod framework supports [preprocessors](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod#preprocess) which are functions that can modify input data before it's send to validation.
One common usecase is type coercion - this package includes a few helpers for that, you can find documentation for those [here](/docs/type-coercion.md).
